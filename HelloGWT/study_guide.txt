RPC Communication:

	http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/tutorial/RPC.html
	
	In traditional web application , client talks to the webserver by refreshing  the complete new html page on receiving the response .
	In contrast ,Ajax does offloading of UI interface logic  to the client side code and only the data exchanged between client & server asynchronously without any 
	browser refresh happens.
	This make client side code more responsive and fluid while reducing the load on the server.
